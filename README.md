# Computer Science Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of fundamental computer science algorithms I've developed during my academic studies and personal projects.

## Projects

### [A* Search Algorithm](./A-Star-Search)
An implementation of the A* search algorithm to solve a black-white pebble game, finding the optimal solution to reposition tokens from an initial state to a goal state.

**Technologies:** Java

### [Graph Search Strategies](./Graph-Search-Strategies)
Implementation of multiple graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS, Uniform Cost Search) using the Strategy design pattern.

**Technologies:** Python

## Skills Demonstrated

- Algorithm design and analysis
- Object-oriented programming
- Design patterns
- Problem solving
- Multiple programming languages (Java, Python)
